      <h1>REACT AND NODE BASED WEB APPLICATION</h1>

      
<p>A web application is any program that works in a web browser.
     Web applications are so widespread in its use since it does 
     not require any specific settings or pre installations. 
     Only a web browser such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari,
      Mozilla Firefox is required to access the application. These 
      applications can be created using browser supported programming
       languages such as PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax etc. A few common
        areas where web applications are mostly widely used are online shopping,
         webmails, social networking apps, online data collection, information display
          such as movie show timings, online ticketing, payment of bills etc. React  is basically 
          a JavaScript library built and maintained by Facebook. 
          According to the creator of React , Jordan Walke, React is an efficient, declarative, and
           flexible open-source JavaScript library for building simple, fast, and scalable frontends of web applications.
