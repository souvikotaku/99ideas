      <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            
      <p>SEO is the talk of every new business and website development. 
          So what is exactly Search Engine Optimization? SEO put in simple
           terms is optimizing the content of your web page or website to make
            it suitable for Search Engines. With millions of web pages available 
            in the internet you can push your web page in top of the search engines 
            if you can manage to get the content right and optimized. Since you have 
            by now already invested thousands or millions into your business, it would
             be of no use if it is not visible when customers look for it the most.
</p>
<p>What SEO does for your business is similar to employers skimming
     through 100s of resumes in the hiring process and finally shortlists
      a few resumes based on the skills/qualifications mentioned in it.
       So if you have a necessary skill but missed to put it out on your resume, 
       the chances are high that you might lose a potential employer. Similarly,
        if your business is inclusive of a specific service or product your customer 
        is looking for, but you failed to mention it in your website, the chances 
        are high that you will lose a potential customers.</p>
        <p>
        More customers you lose = more losses in your business.
        </p>
        <p>
        So how can you get your website visible to your audience amongst millions of other websites? Here are a few steps which will help you succeed.
