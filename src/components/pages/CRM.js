           <li>Stage 1 - Collecting information: The priority should be to capture the information that is needed to identify customers and categorize their behavior. Those businesses with a website and online customer service have an advantage as customers can enter and maintain their own details when they buy.</li>
               <li>Stage 2 - Storing information: The most effective way to store and manage your customer information is in a relational database - a centralized customer database that will allow you to run all your systems from the same source, ensuring that everyone uses up-to-date information.</li>
            <li>Stage 3 - Accessing information: With information collected and stored centrally, the next stage is to make this information available to staff(manager of CRM) in the most useful format.</li>
            <li>Stage 4 - Analysing customer behavior: Using data mining tools in spreadsheet programs, which analyze data to identify patterns or relationships, you can begin to profile customers and develop sales strategies.</li>
            <li>Stage 5 - Marketing more effectively: Businesses find that a small percentage of their customers generate a high percentage of their profits. Using CRM to gain a better understanding of your customers' needs, desires, and self-perception, you can reward and target your most valuable customers.</li>
            <li>Stage 6 - Enhancing the customer experience: CRM gives an opportunity to raise a ticket i.e customers can ask any queries or problems in the services by using this ticket. Ticket can also help maintain the track of the information of queries and helps understand whether the customer's queries were solved. With rasing tickets, we CRM also provides a provision of chat with the support team and can send a message to admin. Just as a small group of customers is the most profitable, a small number of complaining customers often take up a disproportionate amount of staff time. If their problems can be identified and resolved quickly, your staff will have more time for other customers.</li>

    <h1>Advantages Of CRM</h1>
     
      <div class='crm-links'>
        <div className='crm-link-wrapper'>

            <ul className='crm-container-list-items'>
           
               <li>Customer details are stored in an easy to access place. No more searching for customer information on various databases. Customer relationship software enables all customer details to be stored in the same place which can then be accessed by anyone within the business who has the correct permissions. The advantage of having a single centralized CRM in place is that even if you lose employees you’ll always have access to up-to-date customer information. You’ll always have the information at your fingertips to close any sales lead, regardless of employee turnover or lost data.</li>
               <li>CRM gives a professional image to your business. All businesses want their customers to regard them as professional and it can be the little things such as knowing what your customers usually buy that will help to project this image. Knowing the service or products your customers have purchased also enables you to cross-sell or up-sell any additional services/products that you offer to gain additional value.</li>
               <li>Improved Informational Organization: The more you know about your customers, the better you’ll be able to provide them with the kind of positive experience that really pays off. Everything that they do and every interaction that they have with your organization needs to be identified, documented, and recorded. To do this, you need to move beyond the sticky-notes and disorganized filing cabinets and start utilizing advanced organizational techniques that can not only accurately quantify and categorize data for easy future reference but also make that data available across departments. With CRM this all becomes a possibility, it allows you to store a vast list of customers and any important information regarding them. Access to their file is even more convenient than before, so no matter who it is that is helping the customer in question, they’ll have the same actionable data instantly available. This will result in less wasted time for clients and employees.</li>
